In the county, the population was spread out with 23.20% under the age of 18, 7.70% from 18 to 24, 27.00% from 25 to 44, 28.00% from 45 to 64, and 14.10% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 97.00 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.40 males.<br><br>Q: How many people are from 18 to 24?<br>A: 7.70%<br><br>Under coaches Floyd (1995–98) and Larry Eustachy (1998–2003), Iowa State achieved even greater success.  Floyd took the Cyclones to the Sweet Sixteen in 1997 and Eustachy led ISU to two consecutive Big 12 Conference regular season conference titles in 1999-2000 and 2000–01, plus the conference tournament title in 2000.  Seeded No. 2 in the 2000 NCAA tournament, Eustachy and the Cyclones defeated UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen before falling to Michigan State University, the eventual NCAA Champion, in the regional finals by a score of 75-64 (the differential representing the Michigan State Spartans narrowest margin of victory in the tournament).  Standout Marcus Fizer and Jamaal Tinsley were scoring leaders for the Cyclones who finished the season 32-5.  Tinsley returned to lead the Cyclones the following year with another conference title and No. 2 seed, but ISU finished the season with a 25-6 overall record after a stunning loss to No. 15 seed Hampton University in the first round.<br><br>Q: In which years did the Cyclones reach the Sweet Sixteen?<br>A: ["1997", "2000"]<br><br>Coming off their Monday night road win over the Redskins, the Eagles went home for a Week 8 NFC East duel with the New York Giants with the division lead on the line. Philadelphia came out soaring in the first quarter as fullback Leonard Weaver got a 41-yard touchdown run, followed by quarterback Donovan McNabb hooking up with tight end Brent Celek on a 17-yard touchdown pass (with a blocked PAT).  In the second quarter, the Eagles increased their lead as kicker David Akers nailed a 30-yard field goal.  The Giants would get on the board as quarterback Eli Manning found tight end Kevin Boss on an 18-yard touchdown pass, yet Philadelphia kept their momentum going as McNabb completed a 54-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeSean Jackson and a 23-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Jeremy Maclin. The Eagles would increase their lead in the third quarter as Akers booted a 35-yard field goal, yet New York attempted to rally as kicker Lawrence Tynes made a 42-yard field goal and running back Ahmad Bradshaw got a 1-yard touchdown run.  In the fourth quarter, Philadelphia pulled away with a 66-yard touchdown run by rookie running back LeSean McCoy. With the win, not only did the Eagles improve to 5-2, but they would take over as the leader of the NFC East.<br><br>Q: Which was the first scoring play?<br>A: 41-yard touchdown run<br><br>Using 2010 data, there were 28,264 households out of which 31.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.0% were Marriage living together, 24.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.5% were non-families. 38.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

On the morning of 31 October they entered several villages and began indoctrinating the villagers, several of whom slipped away to alert the authorities. ROKA forces soon arrived in the area aboard the UH-1 Huey's of the 6th Aviation Platoon and some of the new UH-1s provided to the ROKA under the Military Assistance Program.

Within two weeks most of the infiltrators had been killed. On 9 December several commandos murdered 10-year-old Lee Seung-bok and 3 other members of his family at their home on the remote northern slope of Gyebang mountain.

Robbie Gould closed the gap to seven points with a 35-yard field goal in the third quarter.  Detroit scored the game's final 10 points in the fourth quarter. Joique Bell capped a 95-yard drive with his second 1-yard TD run and Matt Prater hit a 40-yard field goal, making the final score 34-17.
