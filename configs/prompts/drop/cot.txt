In the county, the population was spread out with 23.20% under the age of 18, 7.70% from 18 to 24, 27.00% from 25 to 44, 28.00% from 45 to 64, and 14.10% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 97.00 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.40 males.

Q: How many percent were not from 45 to 64?
A: The percent of population from 45 to 64 is 28%. So the percent not from 45 to 64 is 100 - 28. Since 100-28=72, the answer is 72.

The Iroquois attacked the Neutral Nation in 1650. By the end of 1651, they had completely driven the tribe from traditional territory, killing or assimilating thousands. At the time, the Neutrals inhabited a territory ranging from the present-day Niagara Peninsula, westward to the Grand River valley. In 1654 the Iroquois attacked the Erie, but with less success. The war between the Erie and the Iroquois lasted for two years. By 1656 the Iroquois had almost completely destroyed the Erie confederacy, whose members refused to flee to the west. The Erie territory was located on the southeastern shore of Lake Erie and was estimated to have 12,000 members in 1650. Greatly outnumbered by the tribes they had subdued, the Iroquois had been able to achieve their victories through the use of firearms purchased from the Dutch.

Q: How many years were between the Iroquois attacking the Neutral Nation, and having completely driven the trade from tradiitonal territory?
A: The Iroquois attacked the Neutral Nation in 1650. The Iroquois completely drove the tribe from traditional territory in 1651. Since 1651-1650=1, there was 1 year between the Iroquois attacking the Neutral Nation, and having completely driven the trade from tradiitonal territory. The answer is 1.

Under coaches Floyd (1995–98) and Larry Eustachy (1998–2003), Iowa State achieved even greater success.  Floyd took the Cyclones to the Sweet Sixteen in 1997 and Eustachy led ISU to two consecutive Big 12 Conference regular season conference titles in 1999-2000 and 2000–01, plus the conference tournament title in 2000.  Seeded No. 2 in the 2000 NCAA tournament, Eustachy and the Cyclones defeated UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen before falling to Michigan State University, the eventual NCAA Champion, in the regional finals by a score of 75-64 (the differential representing the Michigan State Spartans narrowest margin of victory in the tournament).  Standout Marcus Fizer and Jamaal Tinsley were scoring leaders for the Cyclones who finished the season 32-5.  Tinsley returned to lead the Cyclones the following year with another conference title and No. 2 seed, but ISU finished the season with a 25-6 overall record after a stunning loss to No. 15 seed Hampton University in the first round.

Q: How many points did Iowa State lose to Michigan State by?
A: In the game between Iowa State and Michigan State, the score was 75-64. Since 75-64=11, Iowa State lost by 11 pts. So the answer is 11.

Coming off their Monday night road win over the Redskins, the Eagles went home for a Week 8 NFC East duel with the New York Giants with the division lead on the line. Philadelphia came out soaring in the first quarter as fullback Leonard Weaver got a 41-yard touchdown run, followed by quarterback Donovan McNabb hooking up with tight end Brent Celek on a 17-yard touchdown pass (with a blocked PAT).  In the second quarter, the Eagles increased their lead as kicker David Akers nailed a 30-yard field goal.  The Giants would get on the board as quarterback Eli Manning found tight end Kevin Boss on an 18-yard touchdown pass, yet Philadelphia kept their momentum going as McNabb completed a 54-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeSean Jackson and a 23-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Jeremy Maclin. The Eagles would increase their lead in the third quarter as Akers booted a 35-yard field goal, yet New York attempted to rally as kicker Lawrence Tynes made a 42-yard field goal and running back Ahmad Bradshaw got a 1-yard touchdown run.  In the fourth quarter, Philadelphia pulled away with a 66-yard touchdown run by rookie running back LeSean McCoy. With the win, not only did the Eagles improve to 5-2, but they would take over as the leader of the NFC East.

Q: Who threw more touchdown passes, Donovan McNabb or Eli Manning?
A: Donovan McNabb scored the 17-yard, 54-yard, and 23-yard touchdown passes. Eli Manning scored the 18-yard touchdown pass. So Donovan McNabb scored 3 touchdown passes and Eli Manning scored 1 touchdown pass. Since 3>1, Donovan McNabb scored more touchdown passes. The answer is Donovan McNabb.

Using 2010 data, there were 28,264 households out of which 31.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.0% were Marriage living together, 24.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.5% were non-families. 38.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.23 and the average family size was 2.98.

Q: Which was larger, the average household size or the average family size?
A: The average household size is 2.23 and the average family size is 2.98. Since 2.98 > 2.23, the average family size is larger than average household size. So the answer is average family size.

On the night of 30 October 1968, 120 men of Unit 124 landed at 8 separate locations between Ulchin and Samcheok in Gangwon province and moved inland on a 30-day mission to create guerilla bases in the Taebaek Mountains. On the morning of 31 October they entered several villages and began indoctrinating the villagers, several of whom slipped away to alert the authorities. ROKA forces soon arrived in the area aboard the UH-1 Huey's of the 6th Aviation Platoon and some of the new UH-1s provided to the ROKA under the Military Assistance Program. The 36th Homeland Defense Infantry Division, parts of two other Divisions, an ROK Marine Corps battalion, Combat Police companies, an ROK Special Forces Group and thousands of Home Defense Reserves took part in the manhunt that followed. Within two weeks most of the infiltrators had been killed. On 9 December several commandos murdered 10-year-old Lee Seung-bok and 3 other members of his family at their home on the remote northern slope of Gyebang mountain. By the time President Park suspended the operation on 26 December, 110 North Koreans had been killed and 7 captured, for the loss of 40 regular army, police and militia and 23 civilians.

Q: How many North Koreans were killed and captured in total?
A: There were 110 North Koreans that were killed and 7 North Koreans were captured, so 110+7=117 total North Koreans that were killed and captured. The answer is 117.

After a short week, the Lions hosted their division rivals the Chicago Bears for their 75th annual Thanksgiving Day Game. Detroit spotted Chicago a 14-3 first quarter lead, as Jay Cutler hit Alshon Jeffery with touchdown passes of 10 and 6 yards, wrapped around a Matt Prater 46-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Calvin Johnson ended his team's nine-quarter touchdown drought by catching a 25-yard TD pass from Matthew Stafford. Before the half ended, Joique Bell scored on a 1-yard run and Stafford again hooked up with Johnson, this time on a 6-yard TD, putting Detroit up 24-14. Robbie Gould closed the gap to seven points with a 35-yard field goal in the third quarter.  Detroit scored the game's final 10 points in the fourth quarter. Joique Bell capped a 95-yard drive with his second 1-yard TD run and Matt Prater hit a 40-yard field goal, making the final score 34-17. The Lions tallied a season-high 474 yards of offense on the day.

Q: How many yards fewer was Prater's last field goal compared to his first?
A: Prater's last field goal was a 40-yard field goal. Prater's first field goal was 46-yard field goal. Since 46-40=6, Prater's last field goal was 6 yards shorter than his first field goal. The answer is 6.
